# Project Outline

The Local Farmers’s Market Association of Portland (LFMAP) organizes farmer’s
markets in the Portland Area. LFMAP hosts 25 events per month. These events
occur in different locations across the state and each event has zero or more
associated vendors. There are 30 vendors associated with LFMAP and this list is
growing. Each vendor sells zero or more products. Products can be sold by more
than one vendor. Currently there are 110 different products. Each vendor has one
primary contact person. Each person can be the primary contact for zero or more
vendors. Some people are admins for the LFMAP database. Admins do not
necessarily need to be a contact for any vendor.

The Farmer’s Market Database will organize information about Vendors, Products,
People, Events, and Locations.
